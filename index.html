<h1>Types of Shares</h1>

<p>
Shares represent ownership in a company. When you buy shares, you become a part-owner
of that company. However, not all shares are the same. There are different types of
shares, each with its own features, benefits, and risks.
</p>

<h2>Equity Shares</h2>
<p>
Equity shares are the most common type of shares. People who own equity shares are
called shareholders. They have voting rights and can participate in company decisions.
If the company performs well, equity shareholders benefit the most.
</p>

<h2>Preference Shares</h2>
<p>
Preference shares provide fixed dividends and are given priority over equity shares
when dividends are distributed. However, preference shareholders usually do not have
voting rights.
</p>

<h2>Bonus Shares</h2>
<p>
Bonus shares are issued by companies to existing shareholders free of cost. These
shares are given instead of cash dividends and increase the total number of shares held.
</p>

<h2>Rights Shares</h2>
<p>
Rights shares are offered to existing shareholders at a discounted price. This allows
current investors to maintain their ownership percentage in the company.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Understanding the different types of shares helps investors make better decisions.
Beginners should start with equity shares of strong companies and gradually learn
about other share types.
