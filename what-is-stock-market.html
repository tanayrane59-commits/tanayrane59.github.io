<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The stock market is one of the most important parts of the financial system.
It helps companies raise money and gives people an opportunity to grow their
wealth over time. Many beginners think the stock market is complicated or risky,
but with basic knowledge and patience, anyone can understand it.
</p>

<h2>What is the Stock Market?</h2>
<p>
The stock market is a place where shares of companies are bought and sold.
When a company wants to expand its business, it needs money. To raise this money,
the company offers a small part of ownership to the public in the form of shares.
</p>

<p>
When you buy a share, you become a part-owner of that company. If the company
performs well, the value of your shares may increase. If the company performs
poorly, the value may decrease.
</p>

<h2>How Does the Stock Market Work?</h2>
<p>
The stock market works through stock exchanges. A stock exchange is an organized
platform where buyers and sellers meet to trade shares. Prices of shares change
based on demand and supply.
</p>

<p>
If more people want to buy a share, its price goes up. If more people want to sell
a share, its price goes down. This continuous buying and selling creates the
movement in stock prices.
</p>

<h2>Types of Stock Markets</h2>
<p>
There are mainly two types of stock markets:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Primary Market:</strong> Where companies issue shares for the first time.</li>
  <li><strong>Secondary Market:</strong> Where investors buy and sell shares among themselves.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Do People Invest in the Stock Market?</h2>
<p>
People invest in the stock market for various reasons. The most common reasons are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>To grow wealth over the long term</li>
  <li>To beat inflation</li>
  <li>To earn dividends</li>
  <li>To achieve financial goals</li>
</ul>

<h2>Is the Stock Market Risky?</h2>
<p>
Yes, the stock market involves risk, but risk can be managed. Prices may fluctuate
daily, but long-term investing in good companies usually gives better results.
Risk increases when people invest without knowledge or follow tips blindly.
</p>

<p>
Learning basics, diversifying investments, and staying patient can reduce risk
significantly.
</p>

<h2>Difference Between Trading and Investing</h2>
<p>
Trading means buying and selling shares in a short period to earn quick profits.
Investing means buying shares and holding them for a long time to benefit from
company growth.
</p>

<p>
Beginners are usually advised to focus on investing rather than trading.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Investing without research</li>
  <li>Following rumors and tips</li>
  <li>Expecting quick profits</li>
  <li>Ignoring risk management</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

It is a powerful tool for wealth creation when used correctly. Beginners should
focus on learning basics, investing for the long term, and avoiding emotional
decisions.
</p>

With patience and continuous learning, the stock market can become a valuable
part of your financial journey.
